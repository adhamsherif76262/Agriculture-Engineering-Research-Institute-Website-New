        The Central Laboratory for Measurement Devices at the Agricultural Engineering Research Institute is
        one of
        the institute's most significant achievements. It was established to support and advance scientific
        research
        in the field of agricultural engineering. The lab brings together all specialized measurement
        devices in one
        place, facilitating easy access for researchers, which enhances the quality of scientific and
        applied
        research in this field.

                I. Direct Loan:
            </h3>
            <p>This service allows the loaning of devices that do not require advanced technical expertise
                in
                measurement. These include tools such as rotational speed meters, air velocity meters, and
                temperature and humidity gauges. The service is available to all researchers from research
                institutes and universities specializing in agricultural engineering, contributing to higher
                levels
                of applied research and precise measurements according to global standards.</p>

                II. Specialized Research Measurements:
            </h3>
            <p>This service is available for devices that require high technical and engineering expertise
                to
                conduct experiments. A team of specialists carries out these measurements, which include
                complex
                devices used to measure the capabilities of agricultural machinery, whether they are
                mounted, towed,
                or rotating machines, in addition to measuring torque and traction forces.</p>
